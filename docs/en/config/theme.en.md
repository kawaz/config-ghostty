# theme

**Language:** English | [日本語](../../ja/config/theme.ja.md)

## Description

A theme to use. This can be a built-in theme name, a custom theme name, or an absolute path to a custom theme file. Ghostty also supports specifying a different theme to use for light and dark mode. Each option is documented below.

If the theme is an absolute pathname, Ghostty will attempt to load that file as a theme. If that file does not exist or is inaccessible, an error will be logged and no other directories will be searched.

If the theme is not an absolute pathname, two different directories will be searched for a file name that matches the theme. This is case sensitive on systems with case-sensitive filesystems. It is an error for a theme name to include path separators unless it is an absolute pathname.

The first directory is the `themes` subdirectory of your Ghostty configuration directory. This is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ghostty/themes` or `~/.config/ghostty/themes`.

The second directory is the `themes` subdirectory of the Ghostty resources directory. Ghostty ships with a multitude of themes that will be installed into this directory. On macOS, this list is in the `Ghostty.app/Contents/Resources/ghostty/themes` directory. On Linux, this list is in the `share/ghostty/themes` directory (wherever you installed the Ghostty "share" directory.

To see a list of available themes, run `ghostty +list-themes`.

A theme file is simply another Ghostty configuration file. They share the same syntax and same configuration options. A theme can set any valid configuration option so please do not use a theme file from an untrusted source. The built-in themes are audited to only set safe configuration options.

Some options cannot be set within theme files. The reason these are not supported should be self-evident. A theme file cannot set `theme` or `config-file`. At the time of writing this, Ghostty will not show any warnings or errors if you set these options in a theme file but they will be silently ignored.

Any additional colors specified via background, foreground, palette, etc. will override the colors specified in the theme.

To specify a different theme for light and dark mode, use the following syntax: `light:theme-name,dark:theme-name`. For example: `light:Rose Pine Dawn,dark:Rose Pine`. Whitespace around all values are trimmed and order of light and dark does not matter. Both light and dark must be specified in this form. In this form, the theme used will be based on the current desktop environment theme.

There are some known bugs with light/dark mode theming. These will be fixed in a future update:

- macOS: titlebar tabs style is not updated when switching themes.
