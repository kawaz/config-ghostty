# The size of the scrollback buffer in bytes. This also includes the active
# screen. No matter what this is set to, enough memory will always be
# allocated for the visible screen and anything leftover is the limit for
# the scrollback.
# 
# When this limit is reached, the oldest lines are removed from the
# scrollback.
# 
# Scrollback currently exists completely in memory. This means that the
# larger this value, the larger potential memory usage. Scrollback is
# allocated lazily up to this limit, so if you set this to a very large
# value, it will not immediately consume a lot of memory.
# 
# This size is per terminal surface, not for the entire application.
# 
# It is not currently possible to set an unlimited scrollback buffer.
# This is a future planned feature.
# 
# This can be changed at runtime but will only affect new terminal surfaces.
