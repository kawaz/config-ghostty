# Enables the ability to move the cursor at prompts by using `alt+click` on
# Linux and `option+click` on macOS.
# 
# This feature requires shell integration (specifically prompt marking
# via `OSC 133`) and only works in primary screen mode. Alternate screen
# applications like vim usually have their own version of this feature but
# this configuration doesn't control that.
# 
# It should be noted that this feature works by translating your desired
# position into a series of synthetic arrow key movements, so some weird
# behavior around edge cases are to be expected. This is unfortunately how
# this feature is implemented across terminals because there isn't any other
# way to implement it.
