# The named font style to use for each of the requested terminal font styles.
# This looks up the style based on the font style string advertised by the
# font itself. For example, "Iosevka Heavy" has a style of "Heavy".
# 
# You can also use these fields to completely disable a font style. If you set
# the value of the configuration below to literal `false` then that font style
# will be disabled. If the running program in the terminal requests a disabled
# font style, the regular font style will be used instead.
# 
# These are only valid if its corresponding font-family is also specified. If
# no font-family is specified, then the font-style is ignored unless you're
# disabling the font style.
