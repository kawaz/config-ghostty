# Height in pixels or percentage adjustment of maximum height for nerd font icons.
# 
# A positive (negative) value will increase (decrease) the maximum icon
# height. This may not affect all icons equally: the effect depends on whether
# the default size of the icon is height-constrained, which in turn depends on
# the aspect ratio of both the icon and your primary font.
# 
# Certain icons designed for box drawing and terminal graphics, such as
# Powerline symbols, are not affected by this option.
# 
# See the notes about adjustments in `adjust-cell-width`.
# 
# Available in: 1.2.0
