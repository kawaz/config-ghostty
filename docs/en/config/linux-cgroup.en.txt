# Put every surface (tab, split, window) into a dedicated Linux cgroup.
# 
# This makes it so that resource management can be done on a per-surface
# granularity. For example, if a shell program is using too much memory,
# only that shell will be killed by the oom monitor instead of the entire
# Ghostty process. Similarly, if a shell program is using too much CPU,
# only that surface will be CPU-throttled.
# 
# This will cause startup times to be slower (a hundred milliseconds or so),
# so the default value is "single-instance." In single-instance mode, only
# one instance of Ghostty is running (see gtk-single-instance) so the startup
# time is a one-time cost. Additionally, single instance Ghostty is much
# more likely to have many windows, tabs, etc. so cgroup isolation is a
# big benefit.
# 
# This feature requires systemd. If systemd is unavailable, cgroup
# initialization will fail. By default, this will not prevent Ghostty
# from working (see linux-cgroup-hard-fail).
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#   * `never` - Never use cgroups.
#   * `always` - Always use cgroups.
#   * `single-instance` - Enable cgroups only for Ghostty instances launched
#     as single-instance applications (see gtk-single-instance).
