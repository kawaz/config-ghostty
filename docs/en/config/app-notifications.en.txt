# Control the in-app notifications that Ghostty shows.
# 
# On Linux (GTK), in-app notifications show up as toasts. Toasts appear
# overlaid on top of the terminal window. They are used to show information
# that is not critical but may be important.
# 
# Possible notifications are:
# 
#   - `clipboard-copy` (default: true) - Show a notification when text is copied
#     to the clipboard.
#   - `config-reload` (default: true) - Show a notification when
#     the configuration is reloaded.
# 
# To specify a notification to enable, specify the name of the notification.
# To specify a notification to disable, prefix the name with `no-`. For
# example, to disable `clipboard-copy`, set this configuration to
# `no-clipboard-copy`. To enable it, set this configuration to `clipboard-copy`.
# 
# Multiple notifications can be enabled or disabled by separating them
# with a comma.
# 
# A value of "false" will disable all notifications. A value of "true" will
# enable all notifications.
# 
# This configuration only applies to GTK.
# 
# Available since: 1.1.0
