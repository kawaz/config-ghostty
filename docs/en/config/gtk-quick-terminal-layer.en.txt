# The size of the quick terminal.
# 
# The size can be specified either as a percentage of the screen dimensions
# (height/width), or as an absolute size in pixels. Percentage values are
# suffixed with `%` (e.g. `20%`) while pixel values are suffixed with `px`
# (e.g. `300px`). A bare value without a suffix is a config error.
# 
# When only one size is specified, the size parameter affects the size of
# the quick terminal on its *primary axis*, which depends on its position:
# height for quick terminals placed on the top or bottom, and width for left
# or right. The primary axis of a centered quick terminal depends on the
# monitor's orientation: height when on a landscape monitor, and width when
# on a portrait monitor.
# 
# The *secondary axis* would be maximized for non-center positioned
# quick terminals unless another size parameter is specified, separated
# from the first by a comma (`,`). Percentage and pixel sizes can be mixed
# together: for instance, a size of `50%,500px` for a top-positioned quick
# terminal would be half a screen tall, and 500 pixels wide.
# 
# Available since: 1.2.0
# The layer of the quick terminal window. The higher the layer,
# the more windows the quick terminal may conceal.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#  * `overlay`
# 
#    The quick terminal appears in front of all windows.
# 
#  * `top` (default)
# 
#    The quick terminal appears in front of normal windows but behind
#    fullscreen overlays like lock screens.
# 
#  * `bottom`
# 
#    The quick terminal appears behind normal windows but in front of
#    wallpapers and other windows in the background layer.
# 
#  * `background`
# 
#    The quick terminal appears behind all windows.
# 
# GTK Wayland only.
