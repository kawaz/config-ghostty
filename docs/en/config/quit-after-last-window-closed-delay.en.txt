# Controls how long Ghostty will stay running after the last open surface has
# been closed. This only has an effect if `quit-after-last-window-closed` is
# also set to `true`.
# 
# The minimum value for this configuration is `1s`. Any values lower than
# this will be clamped to `1s`.
# 
# The duration is specified as a series of numbers followed by time units.
# Whitespace is allowed between numbers and units. Each number and unit will
# be added together to form the total duration.
# 
# The allowed time units are as follows:
# 
#   * `y` - 365 SI days, or 8760 hours, or 31536000 seconds. No adjustments
#     are made for leap years or leap seconds.
#   * `d` - one SI day, or 86400 seconds.
#   * `h` - one hour, or 3600 seconds.
#   * `m` - one minute, or 60 seconds.
#   * `s` - one second.
#   * `ms` - one millisecond, or 0.001 second.
#   * `us` or `µs` - one microsecond, or 0.000001 second.
#   * `ns` - one nanosecond, or 0.000000001 second.
# 
# Examples:
#   * `1h30m`
#   * `45s`
# 
# Units can be repeated and will be added together. This means that
# `1h1h` is equivalent to `2h`. This is confusing and should be avoided.
# A future update may disallow this.
# 
# The maximum value is `584y 49w 23h 34m 33s 709ms 551µs 615ns`. Any
# value larger than this will be clamped to the maximum value.
# 
# By default `quit-after-last-window-closed-delay` is unset and
# Ghostty will quit immediately after the last window is closed if
# `quit-after-last-window-closed` is `true`.
# 
# Only implemented on Linux.
