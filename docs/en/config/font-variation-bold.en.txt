# A repeatable configuration to set one or more font variations values for
# a variable font. A variable font is a single font, usually with a filename
# ending in `-VF.ttf` or `-VF.otf` that contains one or more configurable axes
# for things such as weight, slant, etc. Not all fonts support variations;
# only fonts that explicitly state they are variable fonts will work.
# 
# The format of this is `id=value` where `id` is the axis identifier. An axis
# identifier is always a 4 character string, such as `wght`. To get the list
# of supported axes, look at your font documentation or use a font inspection
# tool.
# 
# Invalid ids and values are usually ignored. For example, if a font only
# supports weights from 100 to 700, setting `wght=800` will do nothing (it
# will not be clamped to 700). You must consult your font's documentation to
# see what values are supported.
# 
# Common axes are: `wght` (weight), `slnt` (slant), `ital` (italic), `opsz`
# (optical size), `wdth` (width), `GRAD` (gradient), etc.
