**Language:** English | [日本語](../../ja/config/shell-integration-features.ja.md)

## Description

Shell integration features to enable. These require our shell integration to be loaded, either automatically via shell-integration or manually.

The format of this is a list of features to enable separated by commas. If you prefix a feature with `no-` then it is disabled. If you omit a feature, its default value is used, so you must explicitly disable features you don't want. You can also use `true` or `false` to turn all features on or off.

Example: `cursor`, `no-cursor`, `sudo`, `no-sudo`, `title`, `no-title`

Available features:

- `cursor` - Set the cursor to a blinking bar at the prompt.

- `sudo` - Set sudo wrapper to preserve terminfo.

- `title` - Set the window title via shell integration.

- `ssh-env` - Enable SSH environment variable compatibility. Automatically converts TERM from `xterm-ghostty` to `xterm-256color` when connecting to remote hosts and propagates COLORTERM, TERM_PROGRAM, and TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION. Whether or not these variables will be accepted by the remote host(s) will depend on whether or not the variables are allowed in their sshd_config. (Available since: 1.2.0)

- `ssh-terminfo` - Enable automatic terminfo installation on remote hosts. Attempts to install Ghostty's terminfo entry using `infocmp` and `tic` when connecting to hosts that lack it. Requires `infocmp` to be available locally and `tic` to be available on remote hosts. Once terminfo is installed on a remote host, it will be automatically "cached" to avoid repeat installations. If desired, the `+ssh-cache` CLI action can be used to manage the installation cache manually using various arguments. (Available since: 1.2.0)

- `path` - Add Ghostty's binary directory to PATH. This ensures the `ghostty` command is available in the shell even if shell init scripts reset PATH. This is particularly useful on macOS where PATH is often overridden by system scripts. The directory is only added if not already present.

SSH features work independently and can be combined for optimal experience: when both `ssh-env` and `ssh-terminfo` are enabled, Ghostty will install its terminfo on remote hosts and use `xterm-ghostty` as TERM, falling back to `xterm-256color` with environment variables if terminfo installation fails.

## Default

```conf
# https://ghostty.org/docs/config/reference#shell-integration-features
# Features to enable for shell integration (default: cursor,no-sudo,title,no-ssh-env,no-ssh-terminfo,path)
shell-integration-features = cursor,no-sudo,title,no-ssh-env,no-ssh-terminfo,path
```
