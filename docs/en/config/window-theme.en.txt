# The theme to use for the windows. Valid values:
# 
#   * `auto` - Determine the theme based on the configured terminal
#      background color. This has no effect if the "theme" configuration
#      has separate light and dark themes. In that case, the behavior
#      of "auto" is equivalent to "system".
#   * `system` - Use the system theme.
#   * `light` - Use the light theme regardless of system theme.
#   * `dark` - Use the dark theme regardless of system theme.
#   * `ghostty` - Use the background and foreground colors specified in the
#     Ghostty configuration. This is only supported on Linux builds.
# 
# On macOS, if `macos-titlebar-style` is "tabs", the window theme will be
# automatically set based on the luminosity of the terminal background color.
# This only applies to terminal windows. This setting will still apply to
# non-terminal windows within Ghostty.
# 
# This is currently only supported on macOS and Linux.
