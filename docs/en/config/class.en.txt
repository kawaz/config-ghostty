# The setting that will change the application class value.
# 
# This controls the class field of the `WM_CLASS` X11 property (when running
# under X11), the Wayland application ID (when running under Wayland), and the
# bus name that Ghostty uses to connect to DBus.
# 
# Note that changing this value between invocations will create new, separate
# instances, of Ghostty when running with `gtk-single-instance=true`. See that
# option for more details.
# 
# Changing this value may break launching Ghostty from `.desktop` files, via
# DBus activation, or systemd user services as the system is expecting Ghostty
# to connect to DBus using the default `class` when it is launched.
# 
# The class name must follow the requirements defined [in the GTK
# documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gio/type_func.Application.id_is_valid.html).
# 
# The default is `com.mitchellh.ghostty`.
# 
# This only affects GTK builds.
