# The color of the padding area of the window. Valid values are:
# 
# * `background` - The background color specified in `background`.
# * `extend` - Extend the background color of the nearest grid cell.
# * `extend-always` - Same as "extend" but always extends without applying
#   any of the heuristics that disable extending noted below.
# 
# The "extend" value will be disabled in certain scenarios. On primary
# screen applications (e.g. not something like Neovim), the color will not
# be extended vertically if any of the following are true:
# 
# * The nearest row has any cells that have the default background color.
#   The thinking is that in this case, the default background color looks
#   fine as a padding color.
# * The nearest row is a prompt row (requires shell integration). The
#   thinking here is that prompts often contain powerline glyphs that
#   do not look good extended.
# * The nearest row contains a perfect fit powerline character. These
#   don't look good extended.
