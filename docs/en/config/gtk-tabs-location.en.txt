# Determines the side of the screen that the GTK tab bar will stick to.
# Top, bottom, and hidden are supported. The default is top.
# 
# When `hidden` is set, a tab button displaying the number of tabs will appear
# in the title bar. It has the ability to open a tab overview for displaying
# tabs. Alternatively, you can use the `toggle_tab_overview` action in a
# keybind if your window doesn't have a title bar, or you can switch tabs
# with keybinds.
