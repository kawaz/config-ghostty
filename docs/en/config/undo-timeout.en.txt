# The duration that undo operations remain available. After this
# time, the operation will be removed from the undo stack and
# cannot be undone.
# 
# The default value is 5 seconds.
# 
# This timeout applies per operation, meaning that if you perform
# multiple operations, each operation will have its own timeout.
# New operations do not reset the timeout of previous operations.
# 
# A timeout of zero will effectively disable undo operations. It is
# not possible to set an infinite timeout, but you can set a very
# large timeout to effectively disable the timeout (on the order of years).
# This is highly discouraged, as it will cause the undo stack to grow
# indefinitely, memory usage to grow unbounded, and terminal sessions
# to never actually quit.
# 
# The duration is specified as a series of numbers followed by time units.
# Whitespace is allowed between numbers and units. Each number and unit will
# be added together to form the total duration.
# 
# The allowed time units are as follows:
# 
#   * `y` - 365 SI days, or 8760 hours, or 31536000 seconds. No adjustments
#     are made for leap years or leap seconds.
#   * `d` - one SI day, or 86400 seconds.
#   * `h` - one hour, or 3600 seconds.
#   * `m` - one minute, or 60 seconds.
#   * `s` - one second.
#   * `ms` - one millisecond, or 0.001 second.
#   * `us` or `µs` - one microsecond, or 0.000001 second.
#   * `ns` - one nanosecond, or 0.000000001 second.
# 
# Examples:
#   * `1h30m`
#   * `45s`
# 
# Units can be repeated and will be added together. This means that
# `1h1h` is equivalent to `2h`. This is confusing and should be avoided.
# A future update may disallow this.
# 
# This configuration is only supported on macOS. Linux doesn't
# support undo operations at all so this configuration has no
# effect.
# 
# Available since: 1.2.0
