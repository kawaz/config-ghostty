# The title Ghostty will use for the window. This will force the title of the
# window to be this title at all times and Ghostty will ignore any set title
# escape sequences programs (such as Neovim) may send.
# 
# If you want a blank title, set this to one or more spaces by quoting
# the value. For example, `title = " "`. This effectively hides the title.
# This is necessary because setting a blank value resets the title to the
# default value of the running program.
# 
# This configuration can be reloaded at runtime. If it is set, the title
# will update for all windows. If it is unset, the next title change escape
# sequence will be honored but previous changes will not retroactively
# be set. This latter case may require you to restart programs such as Neovim
# to get the new title.
