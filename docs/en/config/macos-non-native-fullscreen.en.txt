# If anything other than false, fullscreen mode on macOS will not use the
# native fullscreen, but make the window fullscreen without animations and
# using a new space. It's faster than the native fullscreen mode since it
# doesn't use animations.
# 
# Important: tabs DO NOT WORK in this mode. Non-native fullscreen removes
# the titlebar and macOS native tabs require the titlebar. If you use tabs,
# you should not use this mode.
# 
# If you fullscreen a window with tabs, the currently focused tab will
# become fullscreen while the others will remain in a separate window in
# the background. You can switch to that window using normal window-switching
# keybindings such as command+tilde. When you exit fullscreen, the window
# will return to the tabbed state it was in before.
# 
# Allowable values are:
# 
#   * `true` - Use non-native macOS fullscreen, hide the menu bar
#   * `false` - Use native macOS fullscreen
#   * `visible-menu` - Use non-native macOS fullscreen, keep the menu bar
#     visible
#   * `padded-notch` - Use non-native macOS fullscreen, hide the menu bar,
#     but ensure the window is not obscured by the notch on applicable
#     devices. The area around the notch will remain transparent currently,
#     but in the future we may fill it with the window background color.
# 
# Changing this option at runtime works, but will only apply to the next
# time the window is made fullscreen. If a window is already fullscreen,
# it will retain the previous setting until fullscreen is exited.
