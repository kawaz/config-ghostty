# Background image opacity.
# 
# This is relative to the value of `background-opacity`.
# 
# A value of `1.0` (the default) will result in the background image being
# placed on top of the general background color, and then the combined result
# will be adjusted to the opacity specified by `background-opacity`.
# 
# A value less than `1.0` will result in the background image being mixed
# with the general background color before the combined result is adjusted
# to the configured `background-opacity`.
# 
# A value greater than `1.0` will result in the background image having a
# higher opacity than the general background color. For instance, if the
# configured `background-opacity` is `0.5` and `background-image-opacity`
# is set to `1.5`, then the final opacity of the background image will be
# `0.5 * 1.5 = 0.75`.
# 
# Available since: 1.2.0
