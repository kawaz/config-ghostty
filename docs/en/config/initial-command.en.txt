# This is the same as "command", but only applies to the first terminal
# surface created when Ghostty starts. Subsequent terminal surfaces will use
# the `command` configuration.
# 
# After the first terminal surface is created (or closed), there is no
# way to run this initial command again automatically. As such, setting
# this at runtime works but will only affect the next terminal surface
# if it is the first one ever created.
# 
# If you're using the `ghostty` CLI there is also a shortcut to set this
# with arguments directly: you can use the `-e` flag. For example: `ghostty -e
# fish --with --custom --args`. The `-e` flag automatically forces some
# other behaviors as well:
# 
#   * Disables shell expansion since the input is expected to already
#     be shell-expanded by the upstream (e.g. the shell used to type in
#     the `ghostty -e` command).
# 
#   * `gtk-single-instance=false` - This ensures that a new instance is
#     launched and the CLI args are respected.
# 
#   * `quit-after-last-window-closed=true` - This ensures that the Ghostty
#     process will exit when the command exits. Additionally, the
#     `quit-after-last-window-closed-delay` is unset.
# 
#   * `shell-integration=detect` (if not `none`) - This prevents forcibly
#     injecting any configured shell integration into the command's
#     environment. With `-e` its highly unlikely that you're executing a
#     shell and forced shell integration is likely to cause problems
#     (e.g. by wrapping your command in a shell, setting env vars, etc.).
#     This is a safety measure to prevent unexpected behavior. If you want
#     shell integration with a `-e`-executed command, you must either
#     name your binary appropriately or source the shell integration script
#     manually.
