# The total amount of bytes that can be used for image data (e.g. the Kitty
# image protocol) per terminal screen. The maximum value is 4,294,967,295
# (4GiB). The default is 320MB. If this is set to zero, then all image
# protocols will be disabled.
# 
# This value is separate for primary and alternate screens so the effective
# limit per surface is double.
