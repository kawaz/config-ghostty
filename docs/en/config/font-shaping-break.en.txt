# Locations to break font shaping into multiple runs.
# 
# A "run" is a contiguous segment of text that is shaped together. "Shaping"
# is the process of converting text (codepoints) into glyphs (renderable
# characters). This is how ligatures are formed, among other things.
# For example, if a coding font turns "!=" into a single glyph, then it
# must see "!" and "=" next to each other in a single run. When a run
# is broken, the text is shaped separately. To continue our example, if
# "!" is at the end of one run and "=" is at the start of the next run,
# then the ligature will not be formed.
# 
# Ghostty breaks runs at certain points to improve readability or usability.
# For example, Ghostty by default will break runs under the cursor so that
# text editing can see the individual characters rather than a ligature.
# This configuration lets you configure this behavior.
# 
# Combine values with a comma to set multiple options. Prefix an
# option with "no-" to disable it. Enabling and disabling options
# can be done at the same time.
# 
# Available options:
# 
#   * `cursor` - Break runs under the cursor.
# 
# Available since: 1.2.0
