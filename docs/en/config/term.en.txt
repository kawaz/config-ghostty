# This will be used to set the `TERM` environment variable.
# HACK: We set this with an `xterm` prefix because vim uses that to enable key
# protocols (specifically this will enable `modifyOtherKeys`), among other
# features. An option exists in vim to modify this: `:set
# keyprotocol=ghostty:kitty`, however a bug in the implementation prevents it
# from working properly. https://github.com/vim/vim/pull/13211 fixes this.
term = xterm-ghostty
