# Font size in points. This value can be a non-integer and the nearest integer
# pixel size will be selected. If you have a high dpi display where 1pt = 2px
# then you can get an odd numbered pixel size by specifying a half point.
# 
# For example, 13.5pt @ 2px/pt = 27px
# 
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect existing
# terminals that have NOT manually adjusted their font size in some way
# (e.g. increased or decreased the font size). Terminals that have manually
# adjusted their font size will retain their manually adjusted size.
# Otherwise, the font size of existing terminals will be updated on
# reload.
# 
# On Linux with GTK, font size is scaled according to both display-wide and
# text-specific scaling factors, which are often managed by your desktop
# environment (e.g. the GNOME display scale and large text settings).
font-size = 13
