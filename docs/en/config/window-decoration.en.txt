# Configure a preference for window decorations. This setting specifies
# a _preference_; the actual OS, desktop environment, window manager, etc.
# may override this preference. Ghostty will do its best to respect this
# preference but it may not always be possible.
# 
# Valid values:
# 
#  * `none`
# 
#    All window decorations will be disabled. Titlebar, borders, etc. will
#    not be shown. On macOS, this will also disable tabs (enforced by the
#    system).
# 
#  * `auto`
# 
#    Automatically decide to use either client-side or server-side
#    decorations based on the detected preferences of the current OS and
#    desktop environment. This option usually makes Ghostty look the most
#    "native" for your desktop.
# 
#  * `client`
# 
#    Prefer client-side decorations.
# 
#    Available since: 1.1.0
# 
#  * `server`
# 
#    Prefer server-side decorations. This is only relevant on Linux with GTK,
#    either on X11, or Wayland on a compositor that supports the
#    `org_kde_kwin_server_decoration` protocol (e.g. KDE Plasma, but almost
#    any non-GNOME desktop supports this protocol).
# 
#    If `server` is set but the environment doesn't support server-side
#    decorations, client-side decorations will be used instead.
# 
#    Available since: 1.1.0
# 
# The default value is `auto`.
# 
# For the sake of backwards compatibility and convenience, this setting also
# accepts boolean true and false values. If set to `true`, this is equivalent
# to `auto`. If set to `false`, this is equivalent to `none`.
# This is convenient for users who live primarily on systems that don't
# differentiate between client and server-side decorations (e.g. macOS and
# Windows).
# 
# The "toggle_window_decorations" keybind action can be used to create
# a keybinding to toggle this setting at runtime.
# 
# macOS: To hide the titlebar without removing the native window borders
#        or rounded corners, use `macos-titlebar-style = hidden` instead.
window-decoration = auto
