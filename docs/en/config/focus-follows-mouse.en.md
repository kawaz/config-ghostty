# focus-follows-mouse

**Language:** English | [日本語](../../ja/config/focus-follows-mouse.ja.md)

## Description

If true, when there are multiple split panes, the mouse selects the pane that is focused. This only applies to the currently focused window; e.g. mousing over a split in an unfocused window will not focus that split and bring the window to front.

## Default

```conf

# Select pane under mouse cursor in split view (default: false)
focus-follows-mouse = false
```
