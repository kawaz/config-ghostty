# Modifies the color used for bold text in the terminal.
# 
# This can be set to a specific color, using the same format as
# `background` or `foreground` (e.g. `#RRGGBB` but other formats
# are also supported; see the aforementioned documentation). If a
# specific color is set, this color will always be used for the default
# bold text color. It will set the rest of the bold colors to `bright`.
# 
# This can also be set to `bright`, which uses the bright color palette
# for bold text. For example, if the text is red, then the bold will
# use the bright red color. The terminal palette is set with `palette`
# but can also be overridden by the terminal application itself using
# escape sequences such as OSC 4. (Since Ghostty 1.2.0, the previous
# configuration `bold-is-bright` is deprecated and replaced by this
# usage).
# 
# Available since Ghostty 1.2.0.
