# The release channel to use for auto-updates.
# 
# The default value of this matches the release channel of the currently
# running Ghostty version. If you download a pre-release version of Ghostty
# then this will be set to `tip` and you will receive pre-release updates.
# If you download a stable version of Ghostty then this will be set to
# `stable` and you will receive stable updates.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#  * `stable` - Stable, tagged releases such as "1.0.0".
#  * `tip` - Pre-release versions generated from each commit to the
#    main branch. This is the version that was in use during private
#    beta testing by thousands of people. It is generally stable but
#    will likely have more bugs than the stable channel.
# 
# Changing this configuration requires a full restart of
# Ghostty to take effect.
# 
# This only works on macOS since only macOS has an auto-update feature.
