# Whether the proxy icon in the macOS titlebar is visible. The proxy icon
# is the icon that represents the folder of the current working directory.
# You can see this very clearly in the macOS built-in Terminal.app
# titlebar.
# 
# The proxy icon is only visible with the native macOS titlebar style.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#   * `visible` - Show the proxy icon.
#   * `hidden` - Hide the proxy icon.
# 
# The default value is `visible`.
# 
# This setting can be changed at runtime and will affect all currently
# open windows but only after their working directory changes again.
# Therefore, to make this work after changing the setting, you must
# usually `cd` to a different directory, open a different file in an
# editor, etc.
