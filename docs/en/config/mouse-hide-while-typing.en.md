# mouse-hide-while-typing

**Language:** English | [日本語](../../ja/config/mouse-hide-while-typing.ja.md)

## Description

Hide the mouse immediately when typing. The mouse becomes visible again when the mouse is used (button, movement, etc.). Platform-specific behavior may dictate other scenarios where the mouse is shown. For example on macOS, the mouse is shown again when a new window, tab, or split is created.

## Default

```conf
# https://ghostty.org/docs/config/reference#mouse-hide-while-typing
# Hide mouse cursor when typing (default: false)
mouse-hide-while-typing = false
```
