# This configuration option determines the behavior of the quick terminal
# when switching between macOS spaces. macOS spaces are virtual desktops
# that can be manually created or are automatically created when an
# application is in full-screen mode.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#  * `move` - When switching to another space, the quick terminal will
#    also moved to the current space.
# 
#  * `remain` - The quick terminal will stay only in the space where it
#    was originally opened and will not follow when switching to another
#    space.
# 
# The default value is `move`.
# 
# Only implemented on macOS.
# On Linux the behavior is always equivalent to `move`.
# 
# Available since: 1.1.0
