# Applies background opacity to cells with an explicit background color
# set.
# 
# Normally, `background-opacity` is only applied to the window background.
# If a cell has an explicit background color set, such as red, then that
# background color will be fully opaque. An effect of this is that some
# terminal applications that repaint the background color of the terminal
# such as a Neovim and Tmux may not respect the `background-opacity`
# (by design).
# 
# Setting this to `true` will apply the `background-opacity` to all cells
# regardless of whether they have an explicit background color set or not.
# 
# Available since: 1.2.0
