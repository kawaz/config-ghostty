# This controls when resize overlays are shown. Resize overlays are a
# transient popup that shows the size of the terminal while the surfaces are
# being resized. The possible options are:
# 
#   * `always` - Always show resize overlays.
#   * `never` - Never show resize overlays.
#   * `after-first` - The resize overlay will not appear when the surface
#                     is first created, but will show up if the surface is
#                     subsequently resized.
# 
# The default is `after-first`.
resize-overlay = after-first
