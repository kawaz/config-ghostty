# async-backend

**Language:** English | [日本語](../../ja/config/async-backend.ja.md)

## Description

Configures the low-level API to use for async IO, eventing, etc.

Most users should leave this set to `auto`. This will automatically detect scenarios where APIs may not be available (for example `io_uring` on certain hardened kernels) and fall back to a different API. However, if you want to force a specific backend for any reason, you can set this here.

Based on various benchmarks, we haven't found a statistically significant difference between the backends with regards to memory, CPU, or latency. The choice of backend is more about compatibility and features.

Available options:

- `auto` - Automatically choose the best backend for the platform based on available options.
- `epoll` - Use the `epoll` API
- `io_uring` - Use the `io_uring` API

If the selected backend is not available on the platform, Ghostty will fall back to an automatically chosen backend that is available.

Changing this value requires a full application restart to take effect.

This is only supported on Linux, since this is the only platform where we have multiple options. On macOS, we always use `kqueue`.

Available since: 1.2.0

## Default

```conf
# https://ghostty.org/docs/config/reference#async-backend
# Low-level API to use for async IO and eventing (default: auto)
async-backend = auto
```
