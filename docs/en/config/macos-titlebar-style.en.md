# macos-titlebar-style

**Language:** English | [日本語](../../ja/config/macos-titlebar-style.ja.md)

## Description

The style of the macOS titlebar. Available values are: "native", "transparent", "tabs", and "hidden".

The "native" style uses the native macOS titlebar with zero customization. The titlebar will match your window theme (see [`window-theme`](window-theme.en.md)).

The "transparent" style is the same as "native" but the titlebar will be transparent and allow your window background color to come through. This makes a more seamless window appearance but looks a little less typical for a macOS application and may not work well with all themes.

The "transparent" style will also update in real-time to dynamic changes to the window background color, e.g. via OSC 11. To make this more aesthetically pleasing, this only happens if the terminal is a window, tab, or split that borders the top of the window. This avoids a disjointed appearance where the titlebar color changes but all the topmost terminals don't match.

The "tabs" style is a completely custom titlebar that integrates the tab bar into the titlebar. This titlebar always matches the background color of the terminal. There are some limitations to this style: On macOS 13 and below, saved window state will not restore tabs correctly. macOS 14 does not have this issue and any other macOS version has not been tested.

The "hidden" style hides the titlebar. Unlike [`window-decoration = false`](window-decoration.en.md), however, it does not remove the frame from the window or cause it to have squared corners. Changing to or from this option at run-time may affect existing windows in buggy ways.

When "hidden", the top titlebar area can no longer be used for dragging the window. To drag the window, you can use option+click on the resizable areas of the frame to drag the window. This is a standard macOS behavior and not something Ghostty enables.

The default value is "transparent". This is an opinionated choice but its one I think is the most aesthetically pleasing and works in most cases.

Changing this option at runtime only applies to new windows.
