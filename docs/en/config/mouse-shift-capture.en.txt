# Determines whether running programs can detect the shift key pressed with a
# mouse click. Typically, the shift key is used to extend mouse selection.
# 
# The default value of `false` means that the shift key is not sent with
# the mouse protocol and will extend the selection. This value can be
# conditionally overridden by the running program with the `XTSHIFTESCAPE`
# sequence.
# 
# The value `true` means that the shift key is sent with the mouse protocol
# but the running program can override this behavior with `XTSHIFTESCAPE`.
# 
# The value `never` is the same as `false` but the running program cannot
# override this behavior with `XTSHIFTESCAPE`. The value `always` is the
# same as `true` but the running program cannot override this behavior with
# `XTSHIFTESCAPE`.
# 
# If you always want shift to extend mouse selection even if the program
# requests otherwise, set this to `never`.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#   * `true`
#   * `false`
#   * `always`
#   * `never`
