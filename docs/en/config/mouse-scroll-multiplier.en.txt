# Multiplier for scrolling distance with the mouse wheel.
# 
# A prefix of `precision:` or `discrete:` can be used to set the multiplier
# only for scrolling with the specific type of devices. These can be
# comma-separated to set both types of multipliers at the same time, e.g.
# `precision:0.1,discrete:3`. If no prefix is used, the multiplier applies
# to all scrolling devices. Specifying a prefix was introduced in Ghostty
# 1.2.1.
# 
# The value will be clamped to [0.01, 10,000]. Both of these are extreme
# and you're likely to have a bad experience if you set either extreme.
# 
# The default value is "3" for discrete devices and "1" for precision devices.
mouse-scroll-multiplier = precision:1,discrete:3
