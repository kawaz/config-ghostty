# Whether or not to quit after the last surface is closed.
# 
# This defaults to `false` on macOS since that is standard behavior for
# a macOS application. On Linux, this defaults to `true` since that is
# generally expected behavior.
# 
# On Linux, if this is `true`, Ghostty can delay quitting fully until a
# configurable amount of time has passed after the last window is closed.
# See the documentation of `quit-after-last-window-closed-delay`.
