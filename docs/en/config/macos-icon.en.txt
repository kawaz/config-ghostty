# Customize the macOS app icon.
# 
# This only affects the icon that appears in the dock, application
# switcher, etc. This does not affect the icon in Finder because
# that is controlled by a hardcoded value in the signed application
# bundle and can't be changed at runtime. For more details on what
# exactly is affected, see the `NSApplication.icon` Apple documentation;
# that is the API that is being used to set the icon.
# 
# Valid values:
# 
#  * `official` - Use the official Ghostty icon.
#  * `blueprint`, `chalkboard`, `microchip`, `glass`, `holographic`,
#    `paper`, `retro`, `xray` - Official variants of the Ghostty icon
#    hand-created by artists (no AI).
#  * `custom` - Use a completely custom icon. The location must be specified
#    using the additional `macos-custom-icon` configuration
#  * `custom-style` - Use the official Ghostty icon but with custom
#    styles applied to various layers. The custom styles must be
#    specified using the additional `macos-icon`-prefixed configurations.
#    The `macos-icon-ghost-color` and `macos-icon-screen-color`
#    configurations are required for this style.
# 
# WARNING: The `custom-style` option is _experimental_. We may change
# the format of the custom styles in the future. We're still finalizing
# the exact layers and customization options that will be available.
# 
# Other caveats:
# 
#   * The icon in the update dialog will always be the official icon.
#     This is because the update dialog is managed through a
#     separate framework and cannot be customized without significant
#     effort.
