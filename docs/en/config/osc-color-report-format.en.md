# osc-color-report-format

**Language:** English | [日本語](../../ja/config/osc-color-report-format.ja.md)

## Description

Sets the reporting format for OSC sequences that request color information. Ghostty currently supports OSC 10 (foreground), OSC 11 (background), and OSC 4 (256 color palette) queries, and by default the reported values are scaled-up RGB values, where each component are 16 bits. This is how most terminals report these values. However, some legacy applications may require 8-bit, unscaled, components. We also support turning off reporting altogether. The components are lowercase hex values.

Allowable values are:

- `none` - OSC 4/10/11 queries receive no reply

- `8-bit` - Color components are return unscaled, e.g. `rr/gg/bb`

- `16-bit` - Color components are returned scaled, e.g. `rrrr/gggg/bbbb`

## Default

```conf
# https://ghostty.org/docs/config/reference#osc-color-report-format
# Set color reporting format for OSC sequences (default: 16-bit)
osc-color-report-format = 16-bit
```
