# The minimum contrast ratio between the foreground and background colors.
# The contrast ratio is a value between 1 and 21. A value of 1 allows for no
# contrast (e.g. black on black). This value is the contrast ratio as defined
# by the [WCAG 2.0 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).
# 
# If you want to avoid invisible text (same color as background), a value of
# 1.1 is a good value. If you want to avoid text that is difficult to read, a
# value of 3 or higher is a good value. The higher the value, the more likely
# that text will become black or white.
# 
# This value does not apply to Emoji or images.
