# Whether the window buttons in the macOS titlebar are visible. The window
# buttons are the colored buttons in the upper left corner of most macOS apps,
# also known as the traffic lights, that allow you to close, miniaturize, and
# zoom the window.
# 
# This setting has no effect when `window-decoration = false` or
# `macos-titlebar-style = hidden`, as the window buttons are always hidden in
# these modes.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#   * `visible` - Show the window buttons.
#   * `hidden` - Hide the window buttons.
# 
# The default value is `visible`.
# 
# Changing this option at runtime only applies to new windows.
# 
# Available since: 1.2.0
