# If `audio` is an enabled bell feature, this is a path to an audio file. If
# the path is not absolute, it is considered relative to the directory of the
# configuration file that it is referenced from, or from the current working
# directory if this is used as a CLI flag. The path may be prefixed with `~/`
# to reference the user's home directory. (GTK only)
# 
# Available since: 1.2.0
