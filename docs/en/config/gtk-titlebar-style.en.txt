# The style of the GTK titlbar. Available values are `native` and `tabs`.
# 
# The `native` titlebar style is a traditional titlebar with a title, a few
# buttons and window controls. A separate tab bar will show up below the
# titlebar if you have multiple tabs open in the window.
# 
# The `tabs` titlebar merges the tab bar and the traditional titlebar.
# This frees up vertical space on your screen if you use multiple tabs. One
# limitation of the `tabs` titlebar is that you cannot drag the titlebar
# by the titles any longer (as they are tab titles now). Other areas of the
# `tabs` title bar can be used to drag the window around.
# 
# The default style is `native`.
