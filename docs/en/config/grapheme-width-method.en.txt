# The method to use for calculating the cell width of a grapheme cluster.
# The default value is `unicode` which uses the Unicode standard to determine
# grapheme width. This results in correct grapheme width but may result in
# cursor-desync issues with some programs (such as shells) that may use a
# legacy method such as `wcswidth`.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
# * `legacy` - Use a legacy method to determine grapheme width, such as
#   wcswidth This maximizes compatibility with legacy programs but may result
#   in incorrect grapheme width for certain graphemes such as skin-tone
#   emoji, non-English characters, etc.
# 
#   This is called "legacy" and not something more specific because the
#   behavior is undefined and we want to retain the ability to modify it.
#   For example, we may or may not use libc `wcswidth` now or in the future.
# 
# * `unicode` - Use the Unicode standard to determine grapheme width.
# 
# If a running program explicitly enables terminal mode 2027, then `unicode`
# width will be forced regardless of this configuration. When mode 2027 is
# reset, this configuration will be used again.
# 
# This configuration can be changed at runtime but will not affect existing
# terminals. Only new terminals will use the new configuration.
