# This controls whether an initial window is created when Ghostty
# is run. Note that if `quit-after-last-window-closed` is `true` and
# `quit-after-last-window-closed-delay` is set, setting `initial-window` to
# `false` will mean that Ghostty will quit after the configured delay if no
# window is ever created. Only implemented on Linux and macOS.
