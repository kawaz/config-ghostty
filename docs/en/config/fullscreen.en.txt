# Start new windows in fullscreen. This setting applies to new windows and
# does not apply to tabs, splits, etc. However, this setting will apply to all
# new windows, not just the first one.
# 
# On macOS, this setting does not work if window-decoration is set to
# "false", because native fullscreen on macOS requires window decorations
# to be set.
