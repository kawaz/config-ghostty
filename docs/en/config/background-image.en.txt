# Background image for the terminal.
# 
# This should be a path to a PNG or JPEG file, other image formats are
# not yet supported.
# 
# The background image is currently per-terminal, not per-window. If
# you are a heavy split user, the background image will be repeated across
# splits. A future improvement to Ghostty will address this.
# 
# WARNING: Background images are currently duplicated in VRAM per-terminal.
# For sufficiently large images, this could lead to a large increase in
# memory usage (specifically VRAM usage). A future Ghostty improvement
# will resolve this by sharing image textures across terminals.
# 
# Available since: 1.2.0
