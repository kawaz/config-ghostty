# The style of the cursor. This sets the default style. A running program can
# still request an explicit cursor style using escape sequences (such as `CSI
# q`). Shell configurations will often request specific cursor styles.
# 
# Note that shell integration will automatically set the cursor to a bar at
# a prompt, regardless of this configuration. You can disable that behavior
# by specifying `shell-integration-features = no-cursor` or disabling shell
# integration entirely.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#   * `block`
#   * `bar`
#   * `underline`
#   * `block_hollow`
