# Control whether Ghostty should synthesize a style if the requested style is
# not available in the specified font-family.
# 
# Ghostty can synthesize bold, italic, and bold italic styles if the font
# does not have a specific style. For bold, this is done by drawing an
# outline around the glyph of varying thickness. For italic, this is done by
# applying a slant to the glyph. For bold italic, both of these are applied.
# 
# Synthetic styles are not perfect and will generally not look as good
# as a font that has the style natively. However, they are useful to
# provide styled text when the font does not have the style.
# 
# Set this to "false" or "true" to disable or enable synthetic styles
# completely. You can disable specific styles using "no-bold", "no-italic",
# and "no-bold-italic". You can disable multiple styles by separating them
# with a comma. For example, "no-bold,no-italic".
# 
# Available style keys are: `bold`, `italic`, `bold-italic`.
# 
# If synthetic styles are disabled, then the regular style will be used
# instead if the requested style is not available. If the font has the
# requested style, then the font will be used as-is since the style is
# not synthetic.
# 
# Warning: An easy mistake is to disable `bold` or `italic` but not
# `bold-italic`. Disabling only `bold` or `italic` will NOT disable either
# in the `bold-italic` style. If you want to disable `bold-italic`, you must
# explicitly disable it. You cannot partially disable `bold-italic`.
# 
# By default, synthetic styles are enabled.
