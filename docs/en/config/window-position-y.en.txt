window-position-y = 
# Whether to enable saving and restoring window state. Window state includes
# their position, size, tabs, splits, etc. Some window state requires shell
# integration, such as preserving working directories. See `shell-integration`
# for more information.
# 
# There are three valid values for this configuration:
# 
#   * `default` will use the default system behavior. On macOS, this
#     will only save state if the application is forcibly terminated
#     or if it is configured systemwide via Settings.app.
# 
#   * `never` will never save window state.
# 
#   * `always` will always save window state whenever Ghostty is exited.
# 
# If you change this value to `never` while Ghostty is not running, the next
# Ghostty launch will NOT restore the window state.
# 
# If you change this value to `default` while Ghostty is not running and the
# previous exit saved state, the next Ghostty launch will still restore the
# window state. This is because Ghostty cannot know if the previous exit was
# due to a forced save or not (macOS doesn't provide this information).
# 
# If you change this value so that window state is saved while Ghostty is not
# running, the previous window state will not be restored because Ghostty only
# saves state on exit if this is enabled.
# 
# The default value is `default`.
# 
# This is currently only supported on macOS. This has no effect on Linux.
