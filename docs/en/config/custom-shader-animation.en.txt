# If `true` (default), the focused terminal surface will run an animation
# loop when custom shaders are used. This uses slightly more CPU (generally
# less than 10%) but allows the shader to animate. This only runs if there
# are custom shaders and the terminal is focused.
# 
# If this is set to `false`, the terminal and custom shader will only render
# when the terminal is updated. This is more efficient but the shader will
# not animate.
# 
# This can also be set to `always`, which will always run the animation
# loop regardless of whether the terminal is focused or not. The animation
# loop will still only run when custom shaders are used. Note that this
# will use more CPU per terminal surface and can become quite expensive
# depending on the shader and your terminal usage.
# 
# This can be changed at runtime and will affect all open terminals.
