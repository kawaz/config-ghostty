# Background image fit.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#  * `contain`
# 
#    Preserving the aspect ratio, scale the background image to the largest
#    size that can still be contained within the terminal, so that the whole
#    image is visible.
# 
#  * `cover`
# 
#    Preserving the aspect ratio, scale the background image to the smallest
#    size that can completely cover the terminal. This may result in one or
#    more edges of the image being clipped by the edge of the terminal.
# 
#  * `stretch`
# 
#    Stretch the background image to the full size of the terminal, without
#    preserving the aspect ratio.
# 
#  * `none`
# 
#    Don't scale the background image.
# 
# The default value is `contain`.
# 
# Available since: 1.2.0
