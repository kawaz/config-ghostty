# Data to send as input to the command on startup.
# 
# The configured `command` will be launched using the typical rules,
# then the data specified as this input will be written to the pty
# before any other input can be provided.
# 
# The bytes are sent as-is with no additional encoding. Therefore, be
# cautious about input that can contain control characters, because this
# can be used to execute programs in a shell.
# 
# The format of this value is:
# 
#   * `raw:<string>` - Send raw text as-is. This uses Zig string literal
#     syntax so you can specify control characters and other standard
#     escapes.
# 
#   * `path:<path>` - Read a filepath and send the contents. The path
#     must be to a file with finite length. e.g. don't use a device
#     such as `/dev/stdin` or `/dev/urandom` as these will block
#     terminal startup indefinitely. Files are limited to 10MB
#     in size to prevent excessive memory usage. If you have files
#     larger than this you should write a script to read the file
#     and send it to the terminal.
# 
# If no valid prefix is found, it is assumed to be a `raw:` input.
# This is an ergonomic choice to allow you to simply write
# `input = "Hello, world!"` (a common case) without needing to prefix
# every value with `raw:`.
# 
# This can be repeated multiple times to send more data. The data
# is concatenated directly with no separator characters in between
# (e.g. no newline).
# 
# If any of the input sources do not exist, then none of the input
# will be sent. Input sources are not verified until the terminal
# is starting, so missing paths will not show up in config validation.
# 
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new
# terminals.
# 
# Available since: 1.2.0
