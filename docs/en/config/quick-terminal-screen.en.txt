# The screen where the quick terminal should show up.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#  * `main` - The screen that the operating system recommends as the main
#    screen. On macOS, this is the screen that is currently receiving
#    keyboard input. This screen is defined by the operating system and
#    not chosen by Ghostty.
# 
#  * `mouse` - The screen that the mouse is currently hovered over.
# 
#  * `macos-menu-bar` - The screen that contains the macOS menu bar as
#    set in the display settings on macOS. This is a bit confusing because
#    every screen on macOS has a menu bar, but this is the screen that
#    contains the primary menu bar.
# 
# The default value is `main` because this is the recommended screen
# by the operating system.
# 
# Only implemented on macOS.
