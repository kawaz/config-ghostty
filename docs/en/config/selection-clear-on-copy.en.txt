# Whether to clear selected text after copying. This defaults to `false`.
# 
# When set to `true`, the selection will be automatically cleared after
# any copy operation that invokes the `copy_to_clipboard` keyboard binding.
# Importantly, this will not clear the selection if the copy operation
# was invoked via `copy-on-select`.
# 
# When set to `false`, the selection remains visible after copying, allowing
# to see what was copied and potentially perform additional operations
# on the same selection.
