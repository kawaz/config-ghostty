# When to scroll the surface to the bottom. The format of this is a list of
# options to enable separated by commas. If you prefix an option with `no-`
# then it is disabled. If you omit an option, its default value is used.
# 
# Available options:
# 
# - `keystroke` If set, scroll the surface to the bottom when the user
#   presses a key that results in data being sent to the PTY (basically
#   anything but modifiers or keybinds that are processed by Ghostty).
# 
# - `output` If set, scroll the surface to the bottom if there is new data
#   to display. (Currently unimplemented.)
# 
# The default is `keystroke, no-output`.
