# custom-shader

**Language:** English | [日本語](../../ja/config/custom-shader.ja.md)

## Description

Custom shaders to run after the default shaders. This is a file path to a GLSL-syntax shader for all platforms.

Warning: Invalid shaders can cause Ghostty to become unusable such as by causing the window to be completely black. If this happens, you can unset this configuration to disable the shader.

Custom shader support is based on and compatible with the Shadertoy shaders. Shaders should specify a `mainImage` function and the available uniforms largely match Shadertoy, with some caveats and Ghostty-specific extensions.

The uniform values available to shaders are as follows:

- `sampler2D iChannel0` - Input texture. A texture containing the current terminal screen. If multiple custom shaders are specified, the output of previous shaders is written to this texture, to allow combining multiple effects.
- `vec3 iResolution` - Output texture size, `[width, height, 1]` (in px).
- `float iTime` - Time in seconds since first frame was rendered.
- `float iTimeDelta` - Time in seconds since previous frame was rendered.
- `float iFrameRate` - Average framerate. (NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED)
- `int iFrame` - Number of frames that have been rendered so far.
- `float iChannelTime[4]` - Current time for video or sound input. (N/A)
- `vec3 iChannelResolution[4]` - Resolutions of the 4 input samplers. Currently only `iChannel0` exists, and `iChannelResolution[0]` is identical to `iResolution`.
- `vec4 iMouse` - Mouse input info. (NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED)
- `vec4 iDate` - Date/time info. (NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED)
- `float iSampleRate` - Sample rate for audio. (N/A)

Ghostty-specific extensions:

- `vec4 iCurrentCursor` - Info about the terminal cursor. `iCurrentCursor.xy` is the -X, +Y corner of the current cursor. `iCurrentCursor.zw` is the width and height of the current cursor.
- `vec4 iPreviousCursor` - Info about the previous terminal cursor.
- `vec4 iCurrentCursorColor` - Color of the terminal cursor.
- `vec4 iPreviousCursorColor` - Color of the previous terminal cursor.
- `float iTimeCursorChange` - Timestamp of terminal cursor change. When the terminal cursor changes position or color, this is set to the same time as the `iTime` uniform, allowing you to compute the time since the change by subtracting this from `iTime`.

If the shader fails to compile, the shader will be ignored. Any errors related to shader compilation will not show up as configuration errors and only show up in the log, since shader compilation happens after configuration loading on the dedicated render thread. For interactive development, use [shadertoy.com](https://shadertoy.com).

This can be repeated multiple times to load multiple shaders. The shaders will be run in the order they are specified.

This can be changed at runtime and will affect all open terminals.
