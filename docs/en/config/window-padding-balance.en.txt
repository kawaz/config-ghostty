# The viewport dimensions are usually not perfectly divisible by the cell
# size. In this case, some extra padding on the end of a column and the bottom
# of the final row may exist. If this is `true`, then this extra padding
# is automatically balanced between all four edges to minimize imbalance on
# one side. If this is `false`, the top left grid cell will always hug the
# edge with zero padding other than what may be specified with the other
# `window-padding` options.
# 
# If other `window-padding` fields are set and this is `true`, this will still
# apply. The other padding is applied first and may affect how many grid cells
# actually exist, and this is applied last in order to balance the padding
# given a certain viewport size and grid cell size.
