# Sets the default blinking state of the cursor. This is just the default
# state; running programs may override the cursor style using `DECSCUSR` (`CSI
# q`).
# 
# If this is not set, the cursor blinks by default. Note that this is not the
# same as a "true" value, as noted below.
# 
# If this is not set at all (`null`), then Ghostty will respect DEC Mode 12
# (AT&T cursor blink) as an alternate approach to turning blinking on/off. If
# this is set to any value other than null, DEC mode 12 will be ignored but
# `DECSCUSR` will still be respected.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#   * ` ` (blank)
#   * `true`
#   * `false`
