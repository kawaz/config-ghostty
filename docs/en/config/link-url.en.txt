# Match a regular expression against the terminal text and associate clicking
# it with an action. This can be used to match URLs, file paths, etc. Actions
# can be opening using the system opener (e.g. `open` or `xdg-open`) or

# Links that are configured earlier take precedence over links that are
# configured later.
# 
# A default link that matches a URL and opens it in the system opener always

# 
# TODO: This can't currently be set!
# Enable URL matching. URLs are matched on hover with control (Linux) or
# command (macOS) pressed and open using the default system application for
# the linked URL.
# 
# The URL matcher is always lowest priority of any configured links (see
# `link`). If you want to customize URL matching, use `link` and disable this.
