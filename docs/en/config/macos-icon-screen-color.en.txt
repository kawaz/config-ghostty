# The color of the screen in the macOS app icon.
# 
# The screen is a linear gradient so you can specify multiple colors
# that make up the gradient. Up to 64 comma-separated colors may be
# specified as either hex (`#RRGGBB` or `RRGGBB`) or as named X11
# colors. The first color is the bottom of the gradient and the last
# color is the top of the gradient.
# 
# Note: This configuration is required when `macos-icon` is set to
# `custom-style`.
