# The directory to change to after starting the command.
# 
# This setting is secondary to the `window-inherit-working-directory`
# setting. If a previous Ghostty terminal exists in the same process,
# `window-inherit-working-directory` will take precedence. Otherwise, this
# setting will be used. Typically, this setting is used only for the first
# window.
# 
# The default is `inherit` except in special scenarios listed next. On macOS,
# if Ghostty can detect it is launched from launchd (double-clicked) or
# `open`, then it defaults to `home`. On Linux with GTK, if Ghostty can detect
# it was launched from a desktop launcher, then it defaults to `home`.
# 
# The value of this must be an absolute value or one of the special values
# below:
# 
#   * `home` - The home directory of the executing user.
# 
#   * `inherit` - The working directory of the launching process.
