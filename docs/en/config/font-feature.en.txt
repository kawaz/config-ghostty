# Apply a font feature. To enable multiple font features you can repeat
# this multiple times or use a comma-separated list of feature settings.
# 
# The syntax for feature settings is as follows, where `feat` is a feature:
# 
#   * Enable features with e.g. `feat`, `+feat`, `feat on`, `feat=1`.
#   * Disabled features with e.g. `-feat`, `feat off`, `feat=0`.
#   * Set a feature value with e.g. `feat=2`, `feat = 3`, `feat 4`.
#   * Feature names may be wrapped in quotes, meaning this config should be
#     syntactically compatible with the `font-feature-settings` CSS property.
# 
# The syntax is fairly loose, but invalid settings will be silently ignored.
# 
# The font feature will apply to all fonts rendered by Ghostty. A future
# enhancement will allow targeting specific faces.
# 
# To disable programming ligatures, use `-calt` since this is the typical
# feature name for programming ligatures. To look into what font features
# your font has and what they do, use a font inspection tool such as
# [fontdrop.info](https://fontdrop.info).
# 
# To generally disable most ligatures, use `-calt, -liga, -dlig`.
