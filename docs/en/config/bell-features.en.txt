# Bell features to enable if bell support is available in your runtime. Not
# all features are available on all runtimes. The format of this is a list of
# features to enable separated by commas. If you prefix a feature with `no-`
# then it is disabled. If you omit a feature, its default value is used.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#  * `system`
# 
#    Instruct the system to notify the user using built-in system functions.
#    This could result in an audiovisual effect, a notification, or something
#    else entirely. Changing these effects require altering system settings:
#    for instance under the "Sound > Alert Sound" setting in GNOME,
#    or the "Accessibility > System Bell" settings in KDE Plasma. (GTK only)
# 
#  * `audio`
# 
#    Play a custom sound. (GTK only)
# 
#  * `attention` *(enabled by default)*
# 
#    Request the user's attention when Ghostty is unfocused, until it has
#    received focus again. On macOS, this will bounce the app icon in the
#    dock once. On Linux, the behavior depends on the desktop environment
#    and/or the window manager/compositor:
# 
#    - On KDE, the background of the desktop icon in the task bar would be
#      highlighted;
# 
#    - On GNOME, you may receive a notification that, when clicked, would
#      bring the Ghostty window into focus;
# 
#    - On Sway, the window may be decorated with a distinctly colored border;
# 
#    - On other systems this may have no effect at all.
# 
#  * `title` *(enabled by default)*
# 
#    Prepend a bell emoji (🔔) to the title of the alerted surface until the
#    terminal is re-focused or interacted with (such as on keyboard input).
# 
#  * `border`
# 
#    Display a border around the alerted surface until the terminal is
#    re-focused or interacted with (such as on keyboard input).
# 
#    GTK only.
# 
# Example: `audio`, `no-audio`, `system`, `no-system`
# 
# Available since: 1.2.0
