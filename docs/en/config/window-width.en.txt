# The initial window size. This size is in terminal grid cells by default.
# Both values must be set to take effect. If only one value is set, it is
# ignored.
# 
# We don't currently support specifying a size in pixels but a future change
# can enable that. If this isn't specified, the app runtime will determine
# some default size.
# 
# Note that the window manager may put limits on the size or override the
# size. For example, a tiling window manager may force the window to be a
# certain size to fit within the grid. There is nothing Ghostty will do about
# this, but it will make an effort.
# 
# Sizes larger than the screen size will be clamped to the screen size.
# This can be used to create a maximized-by-default window size.
# 
# This will not affect new tabs, splits, or other nested terminal elements.
# This only affects the initial window size of any new window. Changing this
# value will not affect the size of the window after it has been created. This
# is only used for the initial size.
# 
# BUG: On Linux with GTK, the calculated window size will not properly take
# into account window decorations. As a result, the grid dimensions will not
# exactly match this configuration. If window decorations are disabled (see
# `window-decoration`), then this will work as expected.
# 
# Windows smaller than 10 wide by 4 high are not allowed.
