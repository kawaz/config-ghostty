# toggle_command_palette

**Language:** English | [日本語](../../ja/actions/toggle_command_palette.ja.md)

## Description

Toggle the command palette.

The command palette is a popup that lets you see what actions you can perform, their associated keybindings (if any), a search bar to filter the actions, and the ability to then execute the action.

This requires libadwaita 1.5 or newer on Linux. The current libadwaita version can be found by running `ghostty +version`.

## Example

```conf
keybind = super+shift+p:toggle_command_palette
```
