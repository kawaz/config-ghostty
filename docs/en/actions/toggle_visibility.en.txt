toggle_visibility:
  Show or hide all windows. If all windows become shown, we also ensure
  Ghostty becomes focused. When hiding all windows, focus is yielded
  to the next application as determined by the OS.
  
  Note: When the focused surface is fullscreen, this method does nothing.
  
  Only implemented on macOS.
