toggle_secure_input:
  Toggle secure input mode.
  
  This is used to prevent apps from monitoring your keyboard input
  when entering passwords or other sensitive information.
  
  This applies to the entire application, not just the focused terminal.
  You must manually untoggle it or quit Ghostty entirely to disable it.
  
  Only implemented on macOS, as this uses a built-in system API.
