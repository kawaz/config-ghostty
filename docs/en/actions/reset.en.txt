reset:
  Reset the terminal.
  
  This can fix a lot of issues when a running program puts the terminal
  into a broken state, equivalent to running the `reset` command.
  
  If you do this while in a TUI program such as vim, this may break
  the program. If you do this while in a shell, you may have to press
  enter after to get a new prompt.
