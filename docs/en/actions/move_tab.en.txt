move_tab:
  Moves a tab by a relative offset.
  
  Positive values move the tab forwards, and negative values move it
  backwards. If the new position is out of bounds, it is wrapped around
  cyclically within the tab list.
  
  For example, `move_tab:1` moves the tab one position forwards, and if
  it was already the last tab in the list, it wraps around and becomes
  the first tab in the list. Likewise, `move_tab:-1` moves the tab one
  position backwards, and if it was the first tab, then it will become
  the last tab.
