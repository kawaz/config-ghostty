undo:
  Undo the last undoable action for the focused surface or terminal,
  if possible. This can undo actions such as closing tabs or
  windows.
  
  Not every action in Ghostty can be undone or redone. The list
  of actions support undo/redo is currently limited to:
  
    - New window, close window
    - New tab, close tab
    - New split, close split
  
  All actions are only undoable/redoable for a limited time.
  For example, restoring a closed split can only be done for
  some number of seconds since the split was closed. The exact
  amount is configured with the `undo-timeout` configuration settings.
  
  The undo/redo actions being limited ensures that there is
  bounded memory usage over time, closed surfaces don't continue running
  in the background indefinitely, and the keybinds become available
  for terminal applications to use.
  
  Only implemented on macOS.
